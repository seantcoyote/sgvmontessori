      <h1>About the Lagunitas Public Montessori Program</h1>

      <p>The Montessori Program, situated on the Lagunitas School campus, spans grade levels kindergarten through fifth grade. The program derives its philosophical base from the teachings of Dr. Maria Montessori, and is committed to her educational precepts and practices. Montessori believed that learning is an exciting process of discovery, leading to concentration, motivation, self-discipline, love of learning and peace.</p>

      <p>The actual <a ui-sref="curriculum">curriculum</a> reflects a fusion of the teachings and materials supported by Montessori and the educational requirements delineated in the California State Frameworks. Through the cultural subjects of—history, geography, and the sciences—students are encouraged to see themselves as the citizens of the world, and they learn to recognize the interrelationships of all living things. It is our goal that children develop a lifelong sense of responsibility for themselves and for the earth.</p>

      <h2>History of our Program</h2>

      <p>Convinced that the Montessori method of education suited their children, a group of parents committed themselves to the task of creating a public Montessori program within the Lagunitas School District. Thus, in November of 1981, Marin Parents for a Public Montessori (MPPM) was founded in San Geronimo. By the fall of 1982, this dedicated group realized their dream. After surmounting the political and financial obstacles inherent in implementing such a program, MPPM proudly opened the doors of Marin County’s first public Montessori classrooms serving students from Kindergarten through grade two at the San Geronimo Campus. The growing needs of the program required the yearly creation of a new classroom that was furnished, financed, and staffed. Motivated parents and staff dedicated to the creation of a public Montessori program successfully met these challenges.</p>

      <p>Parents and staff, throughout the program’s history, have worked to embody the principles of community, cooperation, respect, responsibility, and individual as well as group effort. Making education an adventure has contributed greatly to the Montessori program’s success.</p>


      <h2>Staff</h2>

      <p>All teachers hold a California teaching credential and, pursuant to Lagunitas School District Board policy, training as a Montessori instructor. Newly hired teachers and any teachers being considered for reassignment into the Montessori program are required to hold specialized Montessori training. Candidates with full Montessori Certification are preferred and all training should be complete before teaching in the program. In the classroom, a part-time teacher’s aide and parent volunteers support each teacher. District resource specialists provide consultation and additional instruction for children with special needs in reading, math, and language. Teacher education and staff and curriculum development are
      ongoing processes. Staff participation in workshops, in-service training, and continuing education courses enhances the curriculum and keep teachers in touch with current developments in education. These trainings also enable integration of newer approaches into the Montessori sequence.</p>

      <h2>Classroom Environment</h2>

      <p>The Montessori classroom is a very engaging place where children learn through experience. Two fundamental aspects are observed—the child centered-environment and the effort to maintain a low student-to-teacher ratio achieved with teachers’ aides and volunteering parents. The teacher establishes and prepares the environment and presents a variety of lessons. Beginning in the earliest years, students are gradually expected to manage their own time in light of the work to be done. Thus they learn to focus their attention on a wide variety of project-based activities that allow for the application of knowledge and skills to real world situations. Activities provide purpose, procedure, closure and opportunity for success.</p>

      <p>This sort of curriculum is designed to promote independence, a love of learning, and increasing levels of responsibility for planning work time. To address the needs of the whole child, the curriculum also specifically nurtures cognitive, physical, social-emotional, spiritual, and psychological development. The overall goal is that children experience the joy of self development and mastery and that they perceive themselves as the source of their own learning and growth.</p>

      <h3>Teachers</h3>
      <p>Our program’s teachers embody the core beliefs of Montessori philosophy, such as respect for the individual learner, preparation of the classroom environment, respect for each student’s emotional and developmental needs, and recognizing the intrinsically motivating factors in each individual student. Teachers encourage students’ spontaneous intellectual activity, support self teaching, provide opportunities for community building and give clear and
      meaningful individual and small group lessons.</p>

      <h3>Multi-age Grouping</h3>
      <p>Integral to the Montessori philosophy is the implementation of multi-age classroom groupings. The rationale is that leading, sharing, and modeling peers in a developmental range offers a maximum opportunity for interactive learning. It allows the child to accelerate, review past lessons as needed and reinforce concepts at progressively abstract levels. The Montessori
      curriculum, coupled with wide age groupings, challenges each student to excel.</p>

      <p>A pure Montessori configuration would place children from three to six years of age together, those from six to nine together, and those from nine to twelve together. These groupings (based on child development research) are not always possible in our small public school setting. The program strives to maintain class configurations to include two or three grade levels in which children spend those years in the same class. From the origination of the Montessori Program, the parent organization, (currently PTO) has provided input and feedback to the teacher group and administration on the proposed class configurations for the following year.</p>

      <h3>Physical Environment</h3>
      <p>The Program’s classrooms are equipped with as full as possible range of Montessori materials to support the curriculum. Materials are easily accessible to students and are displayed in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Teachers inspect and evaluate the inventory of specialized Montessori materials and furnishings for completeness and good working condition. The PTO gathers information from the teachers to assess the need to invest in updated Montessori tools and enhancements. Key features in the Montessori classrooms are cleanliness and order, logical organization of materials, appropriately sized furnishings, areas allowing for varying activities (individual/group, floor/table, noisy/quiet, and active/sedentary), and a provision for the display of students’ work.</p>

      <h3>Independence</h3>
      <p>Development is the result of an individual’s own work and experience. As Montessori stated, “My vision is of individuals passing from one stage of independence to a higher, by means of their own activity through their own effort of will, which constitutes the inner evolution of the individual.” The Montessori program respects and encourages the child’s ability to work independently, taking care not to pamper, patronize, or overprotect. Children are assigned real responsibilities and they are expected within reason to act for themselves. Nurturing of the child is directed toward increasing independence and self-sufficiency. Large blocks of uninterrupted instructional time support focused student learning. The Program schedules enrichment activities and transitions to accommodate these blocks.</p>

      <h3>Respect</h3>
      <p>Independent thinking is valued and students are encouraged to express their ideas clearly and respectfully. A sense of respect is extended to the use of material objects in the classroom and the campus facility at large.</p>

      <h3>Class Meetings</h3>
      <p>In addition to the morning circle that begins each day, class meetings are held on a regular or as needed basis. The students often set the agenda, and either a teacher or a student leads the discussion. In this setting, topics such as class projects, playground and interpersonal issues, and future plans are discussed.</p>

      <h3>Punctuality</h3>
      <p>Parents are responsible for ensuring that their children arrive at school on time. It is essential that all students be present at the beginning of class so that they may feel part of the group and oriented for the day’s activities. Interruptions by late children take time and energy from the rest of the class as well as the teacher. Parents should hold any morning social conversations in the parking lot away from classrooms and walkways.</p>

      <h3>Field Trips</h3>
      <p>The curriculum of study for the elementary-aged child is the world. Whenever possible the world is brought into the classroom. Yet, the interests of the child naturally extend beyond the classroom walls. Students are offered opportunities to explore the community, environment, and other settings outside the classroom. Parents attend field trips as volunteer drivers and chaperones—this is essential to the success of each trip. Every effort is made to keep the extra cost of field trips low. In order to provide educational opportunities outside the classroom the Program requests from parents field trip-specific donations to help cover the cost of charges associated with outside excursions. Sometimes, a fee (rather than a requested donation) is required for chaperoning adults. Field trips change each year but some examples or regular favorites include:</p>
