      <ol class="faq">

        <li><span class="faq-question">What is the difference between Montessori and traditional education?</span>
          <p>Montessori emphasizes learning through all five senses, not just through listening. watching or reading. Children in Montessori classes learn at their own pace and plan their work time independently, according to their own choice of activities. Learning is an exciting process of discovery, leading to concentration, motivation, self-discipline and a love of learning. Children learn in multi-age classes, forming communities in which the older children spontaneously share their knowledge with the younger children. Montessori represents an entirely different and very effective approach to education with a curriculum based in studies of geography, history, zoology, and botany.</p>

        <li><span class="faq-question">Is Montessori good for children with learning disabilities? What about gifted children?</span>
          <p>Montessori is designed to help all children reach their fullest potential in their own unique pace. A classroom whose children have varying abilities is a community in which everyone learns from one another and contributes. Moreover, multi-age grouping allows each child to find his or her own pace without feeling "ahead" or "behind" in relation to peers. Students do not receive letter grades and learning is co-operative rather than competitive. Our district has a resource program with speech and occupational therapy for students with identified needs.</p>

        <li><span class="faq-question">Can I do Montessori at home with my child?</span>
          <p>Yes, you can use Montessori principles of child development at home. Look at your home through your child's eyes. Children need sense of belonging and they get it by participating fully in the routines of everyday life. "Help me do it by myself" is the life theme of the child. Can you find ways for your child to participate in meal preparations, cleaning, gardening, caring for clothes, shoes, toys? Providing opportunities for independence is the surest way to build your child's self esteem.</p>
        </li>

        <li><span class="faq-question">What part does the teacher play in guiding the child?</span>
          <p>The teacher builds on natural human tendencies toward exploration, hard work, creativity and communication to create a learning environment that heeds the evolving passions of the children. Through extensive observation and record-keeping, the teacher plans individual projects to enable each child to learn what s/he needs to progress. Each class has a teacher's aide during the morning, so both teacher and aide present small group lessons.</p>
        </li>

        <li><span class="faq-question">How much are parents involved? How frequent is communication with teachers?</span>
          <p>We encourage as much parent participation as possible. These hours may be devoted to whatever activity the parent feels they can most effectively contribute (i.e. special classroom projects, field trips, preparation of classroom materials, gardening, special skills, etc. ) Many parents take a very active role assisting in the enrichment of their child's classroom. There are opportunities to communicate with teachers on a daily basis after 3:00 p.m. and request for longer discussions may be made at any time during the academic year. Formal parent/teacher conferences are scheduled in October and January.</p>
        </li>

        <li><span class="faq-question">Are Montessori children successful later in life?</span>
          <p>Studies show that Montessori children are well prepared for later life, academically, socially and emotionally. In addition to scoring well on standardized testes, Montessori children have a sense of social responsibility and a stewardship for the world that comes from realizing they are citizens of the world. Graduates of Montessori programs are known to be responsible, ask provocative questions, show enthusiasm for learning, adapt easily to new situations and resolve conflicts peacefully.</p>

          <p>Our school is independent of any religious affiliation. We believe it is important to nurture the spirit of the child and to respect all religious beliefs and spiritual paths.</p>
        </li>

        <li><span class="faq-question">What special training do your teachers have?</span>
          <p>The traditional Montessori training is at least a full year of graduate level work for each multi-age grouping and stages of development of children. We have at least one certified (or partially certified) Montessori teacher and one aide in each classroom and often have additional teacher in training.</p>
