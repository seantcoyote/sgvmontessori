      <h1>Montessori Philosophy</h1>

      <h2>Our goal</h2>

      <p>The goal of the Lagunitas Public Montessori Program is to create students who are genuinely excited about learning. Montessori philosophy utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to academics, where, for instance, math lessons may be integrated into an ecology project or reading
      projects may be integrated into the continent study of that year. Teachers create an atmosphere which has a balanced focus on academics, cultural studies, the arts, and emotional literacy.</p>

      <h2>Montessori Philosophy</h2>

      <p>Through the study of world cultures and ecology, Montessori education teaches children to become thoughtful and knowledgeable citizens of the world. The Montessori classroom is organized in such a way that children are able to follow their interests and choose the work to which they are drawn. This fosters independent thinking, development of time management skills, and personal investment in learning. Montessori manipulatives create the opportunity to learn the basics of reading and mathematics through a hands-on, multi sensory approach.</p>
          
      <h2>More Benefits</h2>

      <p>Another key part of Montessori philosophy is the multi-age environment. Not only are there multiple grades (usually 2) in one classroom, but there is also mentoring between older and younger classrooms. Technology and the arts are considered an important part of the educational experience. Starting in second grade, children have access to Chrome Books and complete many assignments on the computer. Each week there is a technology class which often integrates art and technology. There are also weekly pullouts for art, garden, music, PE, and starting in 4th grade students begin learning to play musical instruments in the district wide band.</p>
          
      <h2>Community</h2>

      <p>When you enroll your child in the Montesssori program you also join and wonderfully fun and supportive community. There are many opportunities throughout the year for families to get together and have fun. There is a new student picnic each year before school begins and then a Montessori camping weekend in September. Our big fundraiser "The Fall Festival" is in October and raises money for all the extras our program offers. There are many way to get involved in the program, and wherever your talent lies and whatever your availability, there is a way for you to contribute to make our program even better.</p>
