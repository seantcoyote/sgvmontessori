      <h1>Overview of Lagunitas Public Montessori Program’s Five Great Lessons</h1>

      <p>The Five Great Lessons are a series of five oral stories, using visual and tactile elements, that give the LPMP students an overall impression of the grand topics of the Universe, the Earth and life on Earth. These lessons span 15 Billion years and are meant to give an overarching “theme” and direction of the LPMP’s Cultural Studies academic area. The Five Great Lessons are one of our first gatherings of all students and are extended at appropriate levels in each classroom throughout the school year. Extensions include, for example,  the creation of “Universal Human Needs”, the timeline of the formation of Earth to humans upon it, as well as many geography lessons.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 1: The Story of the Beginning of the Universe</h2>

      <p>This lesson describes the formation of the Universe, including our galaxy and planet formation. It also covers the early days of Earth and it’s creation and changes of it’s minerals, atmosphere, mountains, oceans, lakes and rivers. From this story, students are introduced to key lessons in physics, astronomy, geology, and chemistry. For example, they learn about light, heat, convection currents, gravity, density, galaxies, planetary systems, the earth’s crust, volcanoes, erosion, climate, and physical geography.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 2: The Coming of Life</h2>

      <p>This lesson explains how single-cell and multi-cell forms of life became embedded in the bottom of the sea and formed fossils. It traces the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic periods, beginning with the kingdom of trilobites and ending with human beings.</p>

      <p>The teacher tells where vertebrates began, followed by fish and plants, then amphibians, reptiles, and birds and mammals. This lesson is the basis for lessons in chemistry, nutrition, categories of animals and plants, care and requirements of different animals, and their interrelationship with an ecological system. Students are introduced to formal scientific language of zoology, botany, and anthropology.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 3: The Story of Humans</h2>

      <p>This lesson introduces human beings and their unique endowments of intellect and will. The aim is for the children to imagine what life was like for early humans. This lesson is the basis for lessons in prehistory and the emergence of ancient civilizations. Students are introduced to an analytical tool to compare cultures. They learn how climate and topography influence culture and political geography.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 4: The Story of Language</h2>

      <p>This lesson describes the origin, structure, and types of writing and speaking. It begins with a discussion of the Egyptians, who had two kinds of symbols, one for ideas and one for sounds. The story goes on to describe the Phoenicians, who used the Egyptian’s sound pictures but not their idea pictures. Next, it describes contributions of the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans.</p>

      <p>From this lesson, students use grammar materials, which help them examine how language is put together, and refine capitalization and punctuation. Students are introduced to the study of the origin of English and words from other languages, the meanings of prefixes and suffixes and different forms of writing such as poetry, narrative, and plays. Older children may study Egyptian hieroglyphics or American Indian picture writing.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 5: The Story of Numbers</h2>

      <p>This lesson emphasizes how human beings needed a language for their inventions to convey measurement and how things were made.
      The story describes how the Sumerians and Babylonians had a number system based on 60, which is the reason for our 60-second minute and sixty-minute hour. Greek, Roman and Chinese numbers are introduced. The story describes how our Arabic numerals are similar to numbers found in a cave in India from 2,000 years ago. These Indian numerals had something that no other number system had, the zero.</p>

      <p>This story is the basis for the children’s learning of mathematics, which is integrated into all studies. For example, large numbers are needed in measuring time and space in astronomy; negative numbers are needed when measuring temperature changes; and triangulation was needed to reestablish property boundaries after the Nile flooded ancient Egypt.</p>
