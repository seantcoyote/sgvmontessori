      <h1>What's Great About Montessori</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Fosters a love for learning – from using manipulatives while learning math and grammar to researching areas of interest, students have fun while learning.</li>
        <li>Inspired - students are proud of themselves for the good work they have completed rather than looking for external approval from teacher or parents.</li>
        <li>Independence - students learn to be accountable for their own work and learning.</li>
        <li>Collaboration - group projects allow students to work together and learn from other students.</li>
        <li>Freedom within a structured, prepared environment.</li>
        <li><a ui-sref="five-great-lessons">The 5 Great Lessons</a> are taught at the beginning of every school year and students gain a new level of understanding each time they are presented.
          <ul>
            <li>First Great Lesson – The Story of the Beginning of the Universe</li>
            <li>Second Great Lesson – The Coming of Life</li>
            <li>Third Great Lesson – The Story of Human Beings</li>
            <li>Fourth Great Lesson – The Story of Language</li>
            <li>Fifth Great Lesson - The Story of Numbers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Organization and self-regulation – Within the prepared environment, students get to choose what work to do and (in the older classrooms) how to manage their time.</li>
        <li>Multi-age environment – there are usually 2 grades in each classroom allowing the younger kids to learn from the older. Mentoring between older and younger kids through the buddy program. Middle school kids work as aides in some classrooms. All of this creates a tight-knit family-like school community.</li>
        <li>Strong cultural/geographic Studies – each year a continent is studied culminating in the Continent Day celebration. A North American country is also studied each year. Montessori education creates responsible citizens of the world.</li>
        <li>Many types of instruction - individual, small group, and whole class instruction; hands on learning; learning through student presentations.</li>
        <li>Personal motivation and perseverance - students learn to be self-motivated and to persevere until the work is done.</li>
        <li>Strong academics - State Standards are blended with Montessori Philosophy to create strong academics in a fun environment.</li>
        <li>Well-prepared for Middle School – Montessori teachers work closely with Middle School teachers to make sure students are ready for 6th grade.</li>
        <li>Strong community - many community events through the year: back to school potluck, Montessori campout, Fall Festival fundraiser, Montessori social nights, overnight fieldtrips.</li>
        <li>Creative expression - Montessori’s Cultural Curriculum naturally includes the arts and opportunities for creative expression in the course of daily classroom activities. In addition to this, there are weekly enrichment classes.</li>
        <li>Enrichments classes - in art, music, garden, technology, and band (for 4th and 5th grades).</li>
        <li>Positive discipline approach to behavior is used. Emotional literacy vocabulary and concepts are emphasized in the classroom. A Peace Table format is used in the classrooms and is facilitated by the teachers for conflict resolution between students.</li>
      </ul>
