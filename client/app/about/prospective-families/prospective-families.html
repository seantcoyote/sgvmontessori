      <h2>Lagunitas School District</h2>

      <p>The Lagunitas School District is composed of two campuses, San Geronimo Valley School and Lagunitas School. The district offers parents a unique opportunity to choose between two progressive educational programs for elementary-aged children. The Public Montessori Program and the Middle School are located on the lower Lagunitas School campus. The
      Open Classroom operates from the upper San Geronimo Valley School campus. Students from all three programs continue their education at the Middle School at the Lagunitas School
      campus.</p>

      <p>The District Governing Board is responsible to the community at large and meets regularly at the Lagunitas School campus. Meetings are open to the public and agenda notices are posted via email and on the <a href="http://lagunitas.org/" target="_blank">Lagunitas School District website</a>.</p>

      <p>The district employs an administrative staff for the combined three programs
      including a superintendent, principal, and business manager. Together the superintendent and principal represent school and staff concerns to the District Governing Board. The school principal is available for conference appointments and encourages parents to freely communicate their ideas and concerns.</p>
