      <h1>Curriculum</h1>

      <p>This is an overview of the Montessori curriculm. See the curriculum section of the <a ui-sref="montessori-student-handbook">Montessori program student handbook</a> for a more complete version.</p>

      <h2>MONTESSORI PROGRAM GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h2>

      <p>Curriculum based on cultural studies- history, geography, zoology, botany incorporate these studies into language arts, math promote a sense of humility, world citizenship, personal responsibility, recognize interrelationships of all living things.</p>

      <h2>CULTURAL STUDIES ACTIVITIES REVISITED EVERY YEAR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Five Great Lessons</li>
        <li>Program-wide continent studies</li>
        <li>Program-wide celebrations - Historical Halloween, continent study, culmination, equinox celebrations</li>
        <li>Common needs of people</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>GENERAL APPROACH</h2>

      <p>Student choice- plan sheets and homework (upper grades) offer choices of academic activities that address various levels of difficulty, and students may choose when they want to complete a task.</p>

      <p>Varied Instruction of Academics- Depending on the subject matter, the readiness of students, and the class dynamic, and teachers will use either individual, small group, or whole class instruction.</p>

      <p>Independence and responsibility- through sensorial activities, classroom chores, time management of plan sheet, child centered classroom environment, multi-graded classrooms.</p>

      <p>Use of Montessori materials- classrooms have the needed range of materials to support the curriculum, and materials are used to present new concepts.</p>

      <p>Education for peace- a central tenet of Montessori education; promoted through the cultural studies and activities of teachers in their classrooms.</p>

      <p>Multi-graded classes- students benefit from their roles as both younger and older students. Distinctions between grade levels are deliberately blurred.</p>

      <p>A strong sense of community- activities that bring students at all levels together, and practices that encourage parent involvement in the classroom. Additionally, community service is achieved through interactions with local organizations and communities.</p>


      <h2>CURRICULUM FOR HUMAN VALUES</h2>

      <p>Both the state of California and our Montessori philosophical approach achieves to recognize the need for schools to develop and reinforce good work habits in children, teamwork, perseverance, honesty, self-reliance, and consideration for others. The character of the child is influenced by the many messages he/she receives from the adults around him/her. Our goal is to help the child to reach the highest standards of human behavior and interaction.</p>


      <h2>THE CULTURAL SUBJECTS</h2>

      <p>In Montessori education botany, zoology, history and geography are referred to as the Cultural Subjects. It is our goal to weave the four subject areas together as much as possible so children understand and appreciate the connections of each area of study on the others. Dr. Montessori pointed out that people everywhere have the same material and spiritual needs which they fulfill according to their particular environment and traditions.</p>


      <h2>LANGUAGE ARTS GENERAL OVERVIEW</h2>

      <p>Included in the language arts curriculum are spelling, grammar, genres, handwriting, the writing process, and the development of verbal language. Reading will be addressed separately despite the fact that it is integrated into all the subjects in this section. Our goal is to give children experience and practice with the skills they will need to be proficient readers and writers. We also strive to enhance their natural love of language.</p>

      <h4>Spelling</h4>
      <p>Our goal in spelling is that children use correct spelling in their written work and that they demonstrate an understanding of phonetic rules and patterns. Some teachers prepare low-pressure sight word spelling practice and assessments weekly.</p>

      <h4>Grammar</h4>
      <p>We follow the Montessori curriculum, which includes presentations that teach the parts of speech, grammar usage, punctuation, sentence analysis, and mechanics of language (prefixes, suffixes, etc.) (WHAT ABOUT Mont Symbols and grammar boxes and rationale?)</p>

      <h4>Handwriting</h4>
      <p>Our handwriting instruction leads the student from learning to print, to
      writing in cursive, to keyboarding.</p>

      <h4>The Writing Process</h4>
      <p>Through a variety of activities, children use the written word to express their ideas and to communicate results of their research. Pre-writing, editing, and evaluating their own writing and that of their peers is part of this process in grades 2 through 5. Creative writing and expression of ideas through words are highly encouraged.</p>

      <h4>Verbal Language</h4>
      <p>Group discussions, sharing, oral reports, drama, readers’ theater, class meetings, public speaking, and many other activities contribute to the child’s facility with verbal language.</p>

      <h2>LANGUAGE ARTS- READING</h2>

      <p>Reading is an integral part of all subject areas. It is taught both as a subject in its own right and in context in the cultural subjects and language arts. In the early years, phonics and whole language approaches are both used to give the child the decoding tools and the literary appreciation that are essential to the enjoyment of reading. Skills are listed at the grade level at which they are introduced. Students however are taught skills based on their individual readiness to learn and be challenged. Once skills are introduced, they are reinforced in subsequent grades in a variety of methods.</p>

      <h2>MATH - GENERAL</h2>

      <p>The Montessori math curriculum relies on the manipulative materials invented by Dr. Maria Montessori. They spark the child’s interest and bring a sense of concreteness to a subject that can be quite abstract. New concepts are introduced with a presentation of the appropriate material; then children work with the material until they are ready to move to the abstract level. Teachers supplement the math curriculum with California state texts, workbooks, and materials from a wide variety of publishers. Story problems and math investigations integrate reading, writing, teamwork, and critical thinking skills and are an essential part of the math program. The math sequence presented here will show the grade level at which concepts are introduced. Once introduced, skills are reinforced and expanded using multiple methods in subsequent grades. We value creating confident mathematical thinkers and supporting a positive math mind.</p>

      <h2>MATH - GEOMETRY</h2>

      <p>Maria Montessori’s geometry curriculum is designed to teach the child the relationships of plane and solid figures to math, architecture, and everyday life and to lead the child to an understanding of the use of geometric principles. Through geometry the child can recognize the symmetry of a flower as well as calculate the degrees in an angle. We try to relate the study of geometry to art, botany, and other curricular areas and to make it relevant to the real world. The curriculum is shown in two-year increments and many activities introduced in the early years are revisited later on.</p>

      <h3>KINDERGARTEN-FIRST GRADE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Geometric solid shapes</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>SPECIALIST PROGRAMS</h2>
      <p>Teachers with special training in these subjects are partially funded by parent pledge dollars and partially by the Parcel Tax, which is a valuable supplement to the District’s operating budget.</p>

      <h2>ART</h2>
      <p>Art education is a high priority for parents and staff. Projects are often integrated with the areas of study in the cultural subjects. In addition, students create artistic projects in their classrooms with their classroom teachers.</p>

      <h2>MUSIC</h2>
      <p>The music program offers children the opportunity to learn the elements of music, rhythm, melody, and harmony through singing, movement and playing musical instruments. In the music classroom the students engage in creative movement, singing games, traditional folk dances, choral singing, and playing percussive and melodic instruments. Fourth and fifth graders are eligible to participate in the district band. Above all else, the music program offers the children the joy of making music.</p>

      <h2>GARDENING AND NUTRITION</h2>
      <p>The Montessori students participate in weekly gardening projects at the Upper Campus Main Garden as part of the district-wide gardening program. The Garden program is integrated with our classroom Botany, Zoology and Environmental Education curriculum. (small garden for class projects out back?)</p>

      <h2>PROGRAM CELEBRATIONS AND ACTIVITIES</h2>
      <p>Classroom celebrations and activities are based on the philosophical and developmental principles of the Montessori curriculum. Philosophically, the cultural studies provide the framework for these rituals. Developmentally, the individual child and community are strengthened through these student-directed experiences of cooperation. Some of our seasonal celebrations include the Autumnal Equinox, Historical Halloween, and Spring Equinox. Each teacher and classroom creates its own celebration to honor the students’ birthdays. We discourage handing out party invitations at school unless the entire class is invited.</p>

      <h2>CULTURAL SUBJECTS</h2>
      <p>History, Geography, Zoology, and Botany are referred to collectively as the Cultural Subjects, and they form the core of the Montessori curriculum. At all grade levels students are exposed to and learn about their particular place in a world filled with other creatures and an enormous variety of plants. They explore the interrelationships of people of all cultures and continents as well as the basic needs of all people. Through the study of zoology, students learn about animal classification, evolution, and adaptation. (embriology in alternate years?)</p>

      <p>Each year two continents are studied in depth, giving students a awareness not only of world geography, but also the history and customs of other lands. In the upper grades California and United States history are studied in detail.</p>
