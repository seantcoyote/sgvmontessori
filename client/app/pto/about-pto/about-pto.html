      <h1>PTO</h1>

      <p>We are parents and teachers working together to provide enriching experiences and opportunities for our children. By joining the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) you can make a difference in all our children's education. The PTO includes a group of officers who schedule meetings and manage funds.</p>

      <p><strong>Why do we have a PTO?</strong></p>
      <p>Many years ago Prop 13 cut funding for schools and enrichments like art, music, and classroom aides and this year the district has cut the Montessori Parcel Tax Allocation by 50% (or $12,000) and 100% (or $24,000) for next year to balance the district budget, so parents have to step in and raise money to keep the activities and support they want
        for their children</p>

      <p><strong>What goes on at PTO meetings?</strong></p>
      <p>We help make things happen!. Parents and teachers meet on a monthly basis to craft ways to support our children's education, provide support to our teachers, identify areas of need and allocate resources. We decide how to raise and spend money Teacher(s) attend, tell us what they need, and we decide how to help. We get informed about events, programs and issues that affect your child or family. Our meetings are a fun way to ask questions, meet other parents and get involved in the school. All members of our Montessori family are welcome and encouraged to attend. One of our main hopes for the year is to make the PTO participation FUN and POSITIVE!</p>

      <p><strong>Where does PTO funding come from?</strong></p>
      <p>Our funding comes from LEAP pledges, fundraisers and the Fall Music Festival fundraiser.</p>
