      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>Hi!  I am Alexandra Cusick or “Alex”.  I teach the 4th and 5th grade class in Room 8.  This year, 2015-2016, is my fifth year teaching this grade level.  I have also taught 1st/2nd and 2nd/3rd grades at Lagunitas Montessori in the past and I have taught all ages for over 15 years.  My teaching background is long and extensive but I will try to sum it up quickly (well, not really!)</p>

      <p>Way back when, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in Child Development and a minor in Elementary Education. After graduation, I moved to Maui, Hawaii with a plan to finish up classes to get my teacher credential; however, the School of Education closed that year I moved. Therefore, I did everything I could to work with kids during the five years that I lived there.  I had my own Home Daycare, I was a preschool teacher, I substituted in elementary and middle schools, and I tutored all ages.  Most importantly, I also met my wonderful husband, Mike, there!  Mike and I decided to move back to the Bay Area and I wanted to pursue finishing up my elementary teaching credential.  I went to San Francisco State and entered a program that was dual credential program of a Special Education credential with an emphasis on Deaf and Hard of Hearing and General Elementary Education credential, while teaching three years of 1st and 2nd grades at a small private school in Daly City.  Happily, I then became pregnant with my first daughter, Makena, and I could only then finish at the time my Special Education Credential. I then taught Deaf and Hard of Hearing students K-2nd grades for two years... until I became pregnant with my second daughter, Sierra.  I then took a break from teaching and became the First Five Family Advocate at the San Geronimo Community Center for many years and then... had my third daughter, Lili.  I then decided I wanted to go back to teaching; and began working at the Montessori program while finishing up my credential AND my Montessori training.  I now have a Special Education credential, a  general elementary education credential, and Montessori training.  PHEW!!</p>  
      <p>That leads me to where I am now!!  I have taught all ages and I absolutely LOVE 4th and 5th grade! Besides loving to teach, I love spending time with my family and friends; I love the beach; and I love the sun and outdoors. I feel very lucky to live in the Valley with such an amazing community and to be able to teach at the school that my own children attend.  I LOVE my job! And one last thing… ROOM 8 IS GREAT!!!!</p>
