      <p>Here is Nathan's Bio. His classroom blog and photo gallery are coming soon!</p>

      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>Nathan Murray is a graduate of U.C.S.B. and S.S.U. He currently holds three certifications in education: Multiple Subject Credential, Physical Education Supplemental Authorization and a Montessori Degree from N.A.M.C. He approaches learning in a positive, organic and creative way. Nathan wants each student to gain some "grit" in their pursuit of knowledge. "I believe when a student is steadily challenged they become more engaged in their own learning process. Also, I want them to know the HOW and WHY of learning and not just the work itself." He practices the Montessori philosophy by acting as a guide and by looking at each learner as an individual with very diverse needs and motivations. Additionally Nathan incorporates Technology, Art and Research into many of his project based units.Â He enjoys Frisbee, tacos, movies and snowshoeing. He lives happily with his wife, two children and two dogs.</p>
