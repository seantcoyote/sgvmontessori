      <p>Here is Michelle's Bio, short and sweet, though she says she's going to write more ;-) Her classroom blog and photo gallery are coming soon!</p>

      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>I grew up in Marin County and went to Marin Catholic High School, Chico State and received my teaching credential from Dominican College. I am starting my 15th year at Lagunitas School. I have taught K-5 and now teach K/1.</p>

      <p>After raising my family I decided to go into teaching and to be part of a change in education. I wanted to celebrate the uniqueness of each individual student and create a safe and supportive classroom where a child could thrive and create wonderful memories. I was fortunate to find Montessori and that it aligned with my beliefs&emdash;students in my classroom are nurtured while encouraged to be respectful and independent. They continue to learn how to  care for the world in which they live. I feel blessed to be one of their first teachers and to be part of this learning community.</p>
