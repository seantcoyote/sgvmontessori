      <p>Here is Michelle's Bio, short and sweet, though she says she's going to write more ;-) Her classroom blog and photo gallery are coming soon!</p>

      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>I grew up in Marin County and went to Marin Catholic High School, Chico State and received my teaching credential from Dominican College. I am starting my 15th year at Lagunitas School. I have taught K-5 and now teach K/1.</p>
