      <h1>PTO</h1>

<p>We are parents and teachers working together to provide enriching experiences and opportunities for our children. By joining the PTO you can make a
    difference in all our children's education. The PTO includes a group of officers who schedule meetings and manage funds.</p>

<p><strong>What goes on at PTO meetings?</strong></p>

<p>We help make things happen!. Parents and teachers meet on a monthly basis to craft ways to support our children's education, provide support to our
    teachers, identify areas of need and allocate resources. We decide
    <br/>
    how to raise and spend money Teacher(s) attend, tell us what they need, and we decide how to help. We get informed about events, programs and issues that
    affect your child or family. Our meetings are a fun way to ask questions, meet other parents and get involved in the school. All members of our Montessori
    family are welcome and encouraged to attend. One of our main hopes for the year is to make the PTO participation FUN and POSITIVE!</p>

<p><strong>How can you get involved in the Montessori PTO?</strong></p>

<p>Come to our meetings. Think of new ideas that can help create a better School. Help with our projects - make phone calls, stuff envelopes, join a committee, or simply volunteer at our events. The PTO is you. You can make a difference with as little as a couple of hours. Please come and get involved.</p>
