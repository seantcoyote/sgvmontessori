                (District wide) – The first week in March, LEAP hosts a Scholastic Book Fair. Children visit with their classes and parents are invited to purchase
                books for home, gifts, summer reading, and for teachers’ classroom wish lists. In addition to raising funds for our campus and classroom libraries, we
                generate excitement around books and reading.

                lots of information about the Equinox inform and delight parents and students. After the presentations, there is a field trip to beautiful Divide
                Meadow in Point Reyes where we hike, picnic, play, and explore our natural world and celebrate signs of the coming spring.

                <u>LEAP’s Read-A-Thon</u>
                (District wide)– The entire month of March the entire district participates in a double-goal fundraiser where kids collect sponsorships and keep a log
                (much like summer library reading programs) of their reading. Silent independent reading, being read to before bed, listening to an audiobook, reading
                to a younger sibling or parent, and reading in class all count! This raises money and helps encourage reading.
