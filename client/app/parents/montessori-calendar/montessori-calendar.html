Children visit with their classes and parents are invited to purchase books for home, gifts, summer reading, and for teachers' classroom wish lists. In addition to raising funds for our campus and classroom libraries, we generate excitement around books and reading.</li>
        <li>Spring Equinox &mdash; At 9:00 on the Friday closest to the equinox (March 22), each class shares a presentation in the Montessori Amphitheater. Songs, poetry, skits, and lots of information about the Equinox inform and delight parents and students. After the presentations, there is a field trip to beautiful Divide Meadow in Point Reyes where we hike, picnic, play, and explore our natural world and celebrate signs of the coming spring.</li>
        <li>LEAP's Read-A-Thon (District wide) &mdash; The month of March, the entire district participates in a double-goal fundraiser where kids collect sponsorships and keep a log of their reading (much like summer library reading programs). Silent, independent reading, being read to before bed, listening to an audiobook, reading to a younger sibling or parent, and reading in class all count! This raises money and helps encourage reading.</li>
